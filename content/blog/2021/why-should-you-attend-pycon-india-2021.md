Summary: Advantages and Benefits of attending PyCon India 2021

[PyCon India](https://in.pycon.org/2021/) is the largest annual gathering of Python aficionados and experts in India where Pythonistas come from around the world to celebrate their use of Python, and share their knowledge and experience. Due to the ongoing pandemic, this year, the conference will take place virtually from 17th September to 20th September 2021\. Since the Python community is one of the fastest-growing in the world, A lot of new Pythonistas might not know about the benefits of attending Pycon India. Hence, It's a good time to go through some key reasons on Why do you want to attend Pycon India. To begin with, Let's learn what will actually happen during Pycon India 2021\.

# What happens during PyCon India 2021? 

PyCon India 2021 consists of 3 events rolled into one mega event for 3 days of learning and fun:

* **Conference Days:** September 18-19, 2021 will be the Conference Days. On the conference days, people will be able to connect with other Pythonistas, discuss their experiences, present their ideas, and attend the talks, BoFs and Poster Sessions. 
* **Workshop Day:** Workshop Day will be on September 17, 2021\. On the workshop day, people can attend hands-on workshops, and learn about a topic they have been excited about, but didn't get the time or resources to learn about from an expert.
* **Devsprints:** The Developer Sprints will be on September 20, 2021\. During the Devsprints, people can contribute to open source projects, guided by mentors having experience with open-source and their projects. This is a great opportunity for people to start contributing to Python and other open-source projects.  

Now that we know what is going to happen during PyCon India 2021, Let's learn about some key benefits of attending PyCon India 2021\.   
  

# Learn from Keynote Speakers  
  

PyCon India's Keynote speakers are Python veterans. They come with a fantastic set of Python experience from which all of us can learn a lot. To be more precise, It's not only the technical expertise of these Keynote speakers, But it's their holistic knowledge and experience of using Python and being part of Python's community which we can learn from them. You could be a Python beginner who's written only one line of Python code -  print("Hello World") or You could be another Polyglot or Programming guru trying to upgrade yourself - whoever you are,  the opportunity to listen from these Keynote speakers first-hand and also ask questions and interact with them is an amazing opportunity that is not to be missed.

Python as a programming language is one thing but Python as a Community is an entirely different thing. The above quote by Brett Cannon "Came for the language, Stayed for the community" is acknowledged by Pythonistas across the world. Because it's not just the language that's so special but the super-inclusive, welcoming community where everyone from a beginner to veteran has got a voice and support is definitely a thing to cherish.   

While there are many different ways to be part of the Python Community, PyCon India 2021 presents a unique opportunity to be part of Python India Community. Often on Social Media or anywhere else, You'd hear mostly from Developers from massive following or fan-club. But talent isn't necessarily proportional to social media following. There are a lot of great Python developers in India that we often don't hear from or know about. Pycon India 2021 is the platform for us to hear from these developers, thus making us closely integrated with India's Python Community.   

# One Language - Many Technologies

As we all know, Python is known for its versatility and application across different domains and industries. Hence PyCon India 2021 offers Python talks from 8 different Topic Areas to serve the needs of Pythonistas (or anyone, for that matter). You can learn how Python is being used in the following areas:  

* **Embedded Python and IOT** - MicroPython, Python on Hardware, Robotics, Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
* **Game Design and 3D Modelling** - Python in developing games, 3-D modelling and animation, Game Programming.
* **Desktop Applications** - Qt, GTK+, Tkinter, Gnome, KDE, Accessibility.
* **Networking and Security** - Network Programming, Network Security and Encryption.
* **Data Science, Machine Learning and AI**
* **Core Python** - Language Features, Python Implementations, Extending Python and Standard Library, language internals.
* **Others** - Everything else that may be of interest to the audience.
* **Culture and society** - Diversity, health, productivity, workspace issues, privacy, community building, coding for causes, team building, working remotely.
* **Python in Science Education** - Usage of python in creating experiential learning environments in science and maths classroom. Python to make STEAMD (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Maths and Design) learning more engaging and filled with fun. Python/micropython based laboratory instrumentation for school science laboratory.
* **Developer tools and automation** - Testing, CI/CD, Containers, Orchestration, Logging and Monitoring, Python packaging.
* **Decentralised and Distributed Technology** - Blockchain, Tangle or any DLT protocol or infrastructure related product, cloud.
* **Scientific Computing** - Python usage in scientific computing and research. GIS, Geophysics, Mathematics, Data-visualisation and Simulations. Python powered data-acquisition systems etc. (core libraries Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib)
* **Web development** - Web, APIs, Microservices, Rust and Web Assembly.  

Let's say, You are a data scientist who's interested in Web Development or you're a Network Engineer who's interested in Scientific Computing, PyCon India 2021 is your one-stop solution to learn about the usage of Python across all these domains. Thus, by attending PyCon India 2021, you have grabbed the biggest chance of the year to learn Python from different domains that you can ultimately put to good use in your domain or simply, expand your Python knowledge across different technical fields.   

# Online - Zero Logistics & Diverse Speakers

Every year, PyCon India has been an in-person conference which means it's not just the PyCon tickets you had to manage but also booking transport, managing your accommodation in the city where PyCon India was happening. But due to the ongoing Pandemic, this year PyCon India 2021 is a completely online event. That means All you have to do logistically is ensure you've got an Internet Connection and a Computing Device to attend the conference virtually, thus escaping the usual logistics hassle that requires meticulous planning and coordination.   

Since PyCon India 2021 went online, It's also going to be bigger and more accessible. So more people who couldn't attend PyCon India earlier, only because of travel difficulties, can simply join the joy of attending PyCon without worrying about any of those difficulties. Also because it's an online event, the speakers and sessions are going to be more diverse thus you get the maximum benefit as a participant of PyCon India 2021\.   

# Summary   

In this [blog](https://in.pycon.org/blog/)post, We explored some key benefits of attending PyCon India 2021 like, the opportunity to listen to awesome Keynote speakers, being part of Python's India Community, learning the applications of Python across different domains and topics, and ultimately, attending an Online Conference with Zero Logistics Hassle and learning from more diverse speakers.
